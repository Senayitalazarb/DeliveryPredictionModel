## Earthquake Project: 2000 - 2023
This project analyzes worldwide earthquake data from the period of 2000 to 2023. The goal is to gain insights into the frequency, magnitude, and location of earthquakes during this period.

### Data Sources
The earthquake data used in this project was obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The data includes information about the date, time, location, magnitude, depth, and other characteristics of earthquakes that occurred during the specified time period.

### Data Analysis
The data was analyzed using the Python programming language and various data analysis and visualization libraries including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The analysis includes:

### Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis
Time series analysis
Frequency and magnitude distribution analysis
Spatial analysis using maps and geographic information system (GIS) tools
The findings and results of the analysis are presented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes visualizations and code used to generate them.

### Results and Conclusions
The analysis reveals several interesting insights about earthquakes during the period of 2000 to 2023. Some of the key findings include:

The total number of earthquakes increased over the years, with a peak in 2022 and a decline in recent year
Most earthquakes occurred at shallow depths of 0 - 100 km, but some were as deep as 700 km.
The highest magnitude earthquake during this period was 8.1, which occurred in 2011 in Japan.
The most seismically active regions were the Pacific Ring of Fire, followed by the Mediterranean and Middle East.
Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the patterns and characteristics of earthquakes during the period of 2000 to 2023, which can be useful for future research and disaster preparedness efforts.

### Requirements
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, the following software and packages are required:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Basemap
Geopandas
