## DoorDash: Food Delivery Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the delivery time for food orders placed with DoorDash, a popular food delivery service. The model is designed to help DoorDash better estimate delivery times and provide more accurate delivery estimates to customers.

## Installation
To use this model, you'll need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You'll also need to install the following Python packages:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip, like so:


### Usage
To use the model, you'll first need to download the dataset of DoorDash delivery times. You can find this dataset on Kaggle, or you can create your own dataset by collecting delivery times from DoorDash orders.

Once you have the dataset, you can use it to train the model. The train.py script takes the path to the dataset as a command-line argument, like so:

bash
Copy code
python train.py /path/to/dataset.csv
This script will train the model on the dataset and save the trained model as a file called model.pkl.

Once you have a trained model, you can use it to make predictions on new delivery orders. The predict.py script takes the path to a CSV file containing new delivery orders as a command-line argument, like so:

Copy code
python predict.py /path/to/new/orders.csv
This script will load the trained model and use it to make predictions on the new delivery orders. It will output a CSV file containing the predicted delivery times for each order.
